# Iterator in Haskell

### Overview
In this assignment, you will implement iterators in Haskell. 

You must implement *TWO* iterators, `fmap` and `fold`, for two of the three data structures: a 	`linked list`, a `tree`, and a `queue`. Both functions should exhibit same functionality as shown in Lecture 24.

In order to verify that the code is correct, skeleton code and a test code is provided. The provided files are:

- test.hs
- iterator.hs

You are expected to edit the iterator.hs file, and test.hs is only for testing purpose, feel free to modify it.

### Turn-in

Turn in your code with a README file in a .zip folder on Blackboard. The due is on December 9, 2018, 11:59 PM.
